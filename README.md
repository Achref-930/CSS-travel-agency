# Easy Wonder — Travel Agency

> A small static website for Easy Wonder travel agency. This repository contains the HTML, CSS and image assets used to build the agency's landing pages and sample content.

## What this is

This workspace contains a simple front-end project (static files) for Easy Wonder. It's meant as a small brochure-style site showcasing travel packages and visuals.

## Files & structure

- `B/index50.html` — main HTML file to open in your browser.
- `B/stylesheet.css` — primary stylesheet used by the HTML page.
- `IMG/` — directory with image assets used by the site.

The workspace root is the project folder. The UI and assets live inside the `B` and `IMG` folders.

## How to view the site

2. For live-reload while editing, install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code and open `B/index50.html` with Live Server.

## Contributing
